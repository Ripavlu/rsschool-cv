## Brief information about me
During my school years, I became interested in creating websites. I started trying to change the site code and looked at what had changed on the page. So I got acquainted with some html and css tags. While studying at the university, I spent little time studying websites, which I now regret very much.
At the end of the 3rd year of the university, I was invited to work as a computer science teacher at the school. At school, I was assigned to work on the school website. I created the site using the ucoz constructor, developed and studied the main html and css tags. Thus, I acquired the initial skills in website layout. My goal now is professional development and continuous learning as a front-end developer.
